This project is the culmination of several weeks of work during my internship at VonRoll. It works with a workbook that contains confidential company information. The frontend is displayed below for two of the sheets.

The forecasting is all handled from my code, not using any outside modules or add-ins. The only code that is not mine is the quicksort algorithm, which i obtained here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/152319/vba-array-sort-function.
This is my first major project created with VBA and for any future iterations I would refactor some parts to increase readability, particularly in module 3. I would also delineate the modules more clearly and learn more VBA best practices.
As it is this code isn't meant to be iterated over and improved, it was more important that it works at the end of the summer than for it to be module and readable. To that end it succeeds and I see no reason the code should fail in such
a way that the data is unretrievable. As long as a safe copy is stored and the data maintenance is followed as written, there shouldn't be any problem.
